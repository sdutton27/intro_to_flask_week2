Heroku is no longer Free...
We also have something called Glitch
So we are going to use Render instead to host our projects

You are going to hand off your code to someone else so the requirements.txt needs to be correct to build the virtual environment for everyone

Python web-server gateway interface

    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

Make an account for render

Render -> New -> Web service -> login to Github

link Only select repositories

Connect a repo 

Specific, unique name - intro_to_flask_padawans_simon
Branch main (default)
Don't need to add root directory (default)
Runtime Python 3 (default)

build command: $ pip install -r requirements.txt (default)

start command: $ gunicorn app:app (default)
                        <name of module>:<name of instance,  this is defined in the __init__ for the program>

Create Web Service 

In requirements.txt
python-dotenv -> we should remove the version so mac/pc can all use 

re-upload to github 

hit manual deploy -> deploy the latest commit

in .env you can put PYTHON_VERSION = 3.10.7 -> if you need a later pyton

on right side of render: Environment 
    add Environment variables

    SECRET_KEY = 1234
    DATABASE_URL = {copy this}
    NEWS_API_KEY = {copy this}
